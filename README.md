# Codecademy Asp.Net Capstone Starter Project

In writing, the capstone project "Leagues" for the Codecademy skill path [Build Web Apps with Asp.Net](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/paths/build-web-apps-with-asp-net) provides a starter project that is running in .NET Core 3.1. This means that you will have to install older versions of .NET/.NET Core to get this starter project running, along with multiple dependencies for sqlite.core. 

The starter project in this reposotiry is the same starter project, but updated for .NET 7. Hopefully, this gets you started more quickly if you only have newer versions of .NET installed. 

The starter project was tested on MacOS 12.6.3 with Visual Studio for Mac 17.4.2.

Hope this helps, and happy coding!
